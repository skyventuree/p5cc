# Persona 5 Calling Card Maker

Persona 5 Calling Card Maker is a tool that allows you to create your own calling cards while remaining anonymous.

Version 3 features a variety of customization options to the text over previous ancestors, all processed directly on your browser. No more server processing!

## Local webpage

While you can drag the `index.html` file into your browser and it will just work as usual, however some features is not available or broken on the `file://` protocol.

You can do this quick setup to have a normally functional tool by following the steps below:

0. Have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev) installed on your machine.
1. Open a command prompt/terminal on your machine and change working directory to this folder. Most operating systems have the command `cd` to change directory.
2. Begin to install the dependencies by typing `npm install` in the command prompt/terminal.
3. Run the webpage by typing `node app.js` in the command prompt/terminal. P5CC will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`
