Here goes the translation file.

File name must be your language locale (e.g: English - en). Just copy the English one if one hasn't exist.
English is the default translation set. Make sure your translation file is up-to-date and the version are not mismatched.

Meta tag:
language - The language name in your language.
literal - The language name in English.
font - Font to use for this language. (If you want to use a custom font, let me know in the PR).
version - Version of the translation file.
author - The person doing this file. Feel free to put multiple people.

PR to the translation files (new or old) are only accepted, please don't edit this README file, I will put your GitHub name when merging. Thank you.
